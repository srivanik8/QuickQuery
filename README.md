# QuickQuery
## Inspiration
My inspiration for QuickQuery was as a React dev , it was  a bit difficult for me to come out of my comfort zone and  dive into MERN stack. And got scared after looking at the enormous documentation and delayed my learning path. But on one fine day I read the whole documentation and finally it wasn't that difficult. I built this application for all those folks who don't enjoy reading documentations , or want a quick solution to their problems - Hence the name QuickQuery.

## What it does
QuickQuery is a versatile tool and an all in one destination for MongoDB Queries. Simplifying your database management with our intuitive tool designed for speed and accuracy.  Explore a treasure trove of resources on mongoDB , documentation and it's community. QuickQuery crafts perfect
MongoDB Queries in seconds supporting both python and javascript. QuickSnippet stores all the queries generated and helps in revisiting them anytime , while our vibrant community forum connects devs worldwide. Tune in to QuickQuery for fostering knowledge, support, and connection all within a celebration of DEVS.

## Challenges we ran into
I faced several challenges while working with Express servers, as it was my first time building a backend server. Integrating LangChain.js with the application was also tough due to the lack of resources on integrating LangChain.js with Gemini. However, this experience significantly enhanced my problem-solving skills and determination. I'm proud of this achievement, especially since it was my first time building a MERN application.

## What's next for QuickQuery
The journey continues for QuickQuery! We plan to expand our community, host more engaging  events, and feature even more resources in the application. Additionally, we're exploring folks interested in building a diverse community. Our ultimate goal is to become the go-to resource for mongoDB and help folks build mongoDB applications,by continuously enhancing the support and information we provide. Stay tuned for an exciting journey ahead!
